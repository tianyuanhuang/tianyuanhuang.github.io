Hi, I’m Tianyuan Huang (黄天元), a Ph.D. candidate in Civil Engineering with minor in Computer Science at Stanford University, co-advised by [Ram Rajagopal](https://profiles.stanford.edu/ram-rajagopal) and [Jackelyn Hwang](https://profiles.stanford.edu/jackelyn-hwang). Before coming to Stanford, I obtained my B.Eng. degree from South China University of Technology studying Urban Planning and Computer Science.

My research focuses on machine learning applications in urban sustainability --- particularly applying **computer vision** in the **spatial-temporal** context, such as measuring and mapping urban change using historical street view and satellite images.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
